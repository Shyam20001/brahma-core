# Brahma-JS Monorepo

Welcome to **Brahma-JS**, an open-source high-performance server framework that bridges **Rust** (for networking and async core) with **Node.js** (for application logic). This repository is organized as a **monorepo**.

## Overview

Brahma-JS provides:

* **Rust core** (`brahma-core`) built with [napi-rs](https://napi.rs), managing sockets, HTTP parsing, and async execution.
* **Starter framework** (`brahma-firelight`) for quickly scaffolding new applications.
* **Tests** (`tests`) containing JavaScript checks powered by Vite.

## Monorepo Structure

```
/packages
  â”œâ”€ brahma-core      # Rust crate compiled to Node.js addon (N-API)
  â”œâ”€ brahma-firelight # Starter template framework for apps
  â””â”€ tests            # JavaScript test suite (Vite based)
```

## Features

* ðŸš€ Written in Rust, exposed to Node.js via N-API.
* ðŸ§µ Scales across multiple cores (Tokio runtime).
* ðŸ”’ One-shot request/response guarantees.
* ðŸ“¦ Organized as a monorepo for easy collaboration.
